1.  Click "Start" to begin the experiment. You will see an intercepted packet displayed on the terminal, demonstrating communication over an unencrypted channel.

2.  The client sends a key request to the server. In response, the server sends back a key for encrypted communication.

3.  Click "Next" to create an encrypted channel. The client then sends the encrypted username and a new key for a second encrypted channel.

4.  Click "Next" again to create the second encrypted channel, which uses the key from the previous step. The client then sends the final encrypted packet.

5.  Now, identify the encryption method from the message in the unencrypted channel.

6.  Use the "Decrypt" tool under the "ENCRYPTION METHODS" toggle to decrypt the intercepted messages.

7.  Copy the decrypted username and password and enter them into the corresponding text fields.

8.  Click "Verify." The experiment is successful if the decrypted username and password are correct.
