### Procedure

1. To begin, click on "Start". When there is communication between the client and server, the packet is being intercepted and displayed on the terminal. This is possible as the channel being used is unencrypted.

2. A key request is sent from the client to the server, to which the server responds with a response containing the key for further encrypted communication

3. Click "Next" again to create an encrypted channel to exchange further packets. The encrypted username, and the key for the second encrypted channel are sent here.

4. Click “Next” to to create the second encrypted channel, which will be using the key sent in the previous channel for encryption. The encrypted packet is sent here. 

5. Now, identify the encryption method used from the message in the unencrypted channel and then use the de-encrypt tool provided under the 'ENCRYPTION METHODS' toggle to decrypt.

12. Copy the username and password once it has been decrypted and enter it in the corresponding text fields provided on screen.

13. Click on “Verify”, the experiment is successful if both the username and password that the hacker intercepted and decrypted are correct.
